            <h3>About Me</h3> 
            <p>I grew up in Marshfield, WI and graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Stout with a degree in Business Administration.  I currently work at a Fintech company call ClickSWITCH.  Our company streamlines the process of switching to a new financial institution.</p>

            <p>The reason I am taking this course is because my interest in development has grown since I have joined my comapany.  I believe I have a lot to contribute when it comes to building our application, so once I finish this course I hope to move to our development team.</p>
